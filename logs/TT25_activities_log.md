## Trillium Trail Plant-Soil Feedback Experiment Daily Activities Log


**Tuesday 12/24**
 - Evan gave all pots 100 mL of tap water
    - Premature watering due to MCL e-mail mentioning pesticide usage in some facility growth chambers (not in our growth chamber) and greenhouses on 12/26. E-mail mentioned to avoid treated area for 30 hours. Area avoided out of abundance of caution - will revisit growth chamber in afternoon of 12/27 to check for new growth
    - Soil seems to be drying out quite quickly - consider modifying water schedule to every 4 days to avoid inducing drought response
 - Three pots have signs of growth

**Friday 12/20**
 - Evan rearranged plants according to their treatment and separated plants based on whether they were Maianthemum or Trillium (to ensure easy loading of Maianthemum into reach-in growth chambers in Smith Lab)
 - Evan gave all plants 100 mL of tap water. Note: water was added such that Mai with multiple pots received 100 mL water _total_ across entire pot. This is likely insufficient, so future water doses should be 100mL in each and every pot
 - Evan and Jessie chatted about experiment growth conditions - it seems that we should use biweekly time steps for the entire experiment as soil temps for May, June, and July exhibit gradual warming pattern
    - May: 13.5-14degC daytime temp, 12.5degC nighttime temp
    - June: 17degC daytime temp, 16degC nighttime temp
    - July: 19.5degC daytime temp, 18-19degC nighttime temp

**Thursday 12/19**
 - Monika and Evan put new labels on all plants. Tags include the tag_id and species ("T" for Trillium, "M" for Maianthemum) and are color coded based on the treatment
 - Stephanie mentioned plants were watered last Thursday and have received 100mL of tap water

**Wednesday 12/18**
 - Monika, Evan, Nick, Alissar, Dan, and Zinny unloaded plants and soil bins from truck to growth chamber
 - Pots and pot containers transported to lab for temporary storage
 - Evan asked Mylea (Phytotron manager) shifted photoperiod in program from 12 hour photoperiod to 10 hour photoperiod following TT group meeting on 12/17
 - Nick asked if we need to arrange plants in any particular fashion. Stephanie responded mentioning that it might be good to separate pots by treatment to avoid contamination

**Tuesday 12/17**
 - Monika continued driving to Lubbock
 - Truck continuing to refrigerate plants at 4degC

**Monday 12/16**
 - Monika picked up Trillium Trail plants, soil, and pots from UTK
 - Monika started driving back to Lubbock. 
 - Truck refrigerated plants at 4degC throughout trip
