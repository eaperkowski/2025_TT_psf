# Trillium Trail Plant-Soil Feedback Experiment Daily Activities Log

## Tuesday 1/28
 - Evan inspected Mai in reach-in growth chamber. Performed some chamber maintenance and decided that Mai should only be watered every five days while in the reach-in chamber. 
      - Pots are simply not drying out as they were in the walk-in chamber
 - Evan finalize growth chamber settings for the rest of the experiment using TOMST soil temperature probe data sent by JM

## Monday 1/27
 - Evan and Monika gave Trillium pots 100 mL of tap water
      - Monika noticed some algae/mold growing in between mesh layers of sterile treatment - sent Stephanie an e-mail to ask if we need to swap out the gaskets
      - Monika also noticed water transfer between mesh layers when mesh touches each other. Also contacted Stephanie over this to see if there is a solution
 - Monika continued putting second half of split pots together for Trillium. UG RAs assisted with sterilizing pots
      - Note: need to take inventory of remaining pots to see if we need to order more from S&S
 - Evan change program for Mai in reach-in chamber to overwinter part II (12.5C/10C day/night temps with 500 umol maximum. 12 hr photoperiod)

## Sunday 1/26
 - Monika continued putting second half of split pots together for Trillium. UG RAs assisted with sterilizing pots

## Saturday 1/25
 - Evan and Monika gave Mai and Trillium pots 100 mL of tap water
 - Monika continued putting second half of split pots together for Trillium.

## Friday 1/24
 - Evan and Monika trip to Home Depot to buy smaller clamps
 - Monika started putting second half of split pots together for Trillium. UG RAs assisted with sterilizing pots

## Thursday 1/23
 - Evan and Monika gave Trillium and Mai pots 100 mL of tap water

## Tuesday 1/21
 - Evan and Monika gave Trillium pots 100 mL of tap water

## Sunday 1/19
 - Evan and Monika gave all plants 100 mL of tap water

## Friday 1/17
 - Evan and Monika found chamber 5 to be at 30degC, treatments "yellow" (PlantW-SoilNW-FungNW) and "purple" (PlantNW-SoilW-FungW), and "purple_blue" (PlantNW-SoilW-FungWsterile) impacted and moved to other working chambers
 - Monika verified tags
   - Maianthemum: all accounted for
   - Trillium: missing individual "762", have an extra individual "6884 Tri 6W-19" 

## Thursday 1/16
 - Evan, Monika, and Ava moved all Maianthemum up to reach-in growth chambers for overwintering (chambers 1 - 5)
 - Evan, Monika, and Ava gave all plants 100 mL of tap water
 - Reach-in chambers with Maianthemum programmed to: "TT-Mai" (same program as overwinter Pt. 1 in walk-in chamber)

## Monday 1/13
 - Evan and Monika gave all plants 100 mL of tap water before TT summit meeting
 - TT folks visited plants and were happy with overall setup. Susan mentioned to be more careful with watering to avoid "pit" at center of pots

## Friday 1/10
 - Evan and Monika gave all plants 100 mL of tap water

## Tuesday 1/7
 - Evan and Monika gave all plants 100 mL of tap water
 - Plants seem to be drying out after 4 days - should probably move to water every 3 days
 - New Tri emergence: 1374, 5852, flag1_tri, 2912, 5722, 5626 (unwhorling), 4942, 3043

## Friday 1/3
 - Evan and Monika gave all plants 100 mL of tap water

## Wednesday 12/31
 - Evan and Monika gave all plants 100 mL of tap water
 - 5626 an additional Trillium emergent

## Saturday 12/28
 - Evan gave all pots 100 mL of tap water
 - Some Tri emerging: flag1_tri, 972, 1374, 2547, 2912, 3043. Some other spp emerging from 4071 and 4934 that look like a bean sprout cotyledon

## Tuesday 12/24
 - Evan gave all pots 100 mL of tap water
    - Premature watering due to MCL e-mail mentioning pesticide usage in some facility growth chambers (not in our growth chamber) and greenhouses on 12/26. E-mail mentioned to avoid treated area for 30 hours. Area avoided out of abundance of caution - will revisit growth chamber in afternoon of 12/27 to check for new growth
    - Soil seems to be drying out quite quickly - consider modifying water schedule to every 4 days to avoid inducing drought response
 - Three pots have signs of growth

## Friday 12/20
 - Evan rearranged plants according to their treatment and separated plants based on whether they were Maianthemum or Trillium (to ensure easy loading of Maianthemum into reach-in growth chambers in Smith Lab)
 - Evan gave all plants 100 mL of tap water. Note: water was added such that Mai with multiple pots received 100 mL water _total_ across entire pot. This is likely insufficient, so future water doses should be 100mL in each and every pot
 - Evan and Jessie chatted about experiment growth conditions - it seems that we should use biweekly time steps for the entire experiment as soil temps for May, June, and July exhibit gradual warming pattern
    - May: 13.5-14degC daytime temp, 12.5degC nighttime temp
    - June: 17degC daytime temp, 16degC nighttime temp
    - July: 19.5degC daytime temp, 18-19degC nighttime temp

## Thursday 12/19
 - Monika and Evan put new labels on all plants. Tags include the tag_id and species ("T" for Trillium, "M" for Maianthemum) and are color coded based on the treatment
 - Stephanie mentioned plants were watered last Thursday and have received 100mL of tap water

## Wednesday 12/18
 - Monika, Evan, Nick, Alissar, Dan, and Zinny unloaded plants and soil bins from truck to growth chamber
 - Pots and pot containers transported to lab for temporary storage
 - Evan asked Mylea (Phytotron manager) shifted photoperiod in program from 12 hour photoperiod to 10 hour photoperiod following TT group meeting on 12/17
 - Nick asked if we need to arrange plants in any particular fashion. Stephanie responded mentioning that it might be good to separate pots by treatment to avoid contamination

## Tuesday 12/17
 - Monika continued driving to Lubbock
 - Truck continuing to refrigerate plants at 4degC

## Monday 12/16
 - Monika picked up Trillium Trail plants, soil, and pots from UTK
 - Monika started driving back to Lubbock. 
 - Truck refrigerated plants at 4degC throughout trip
